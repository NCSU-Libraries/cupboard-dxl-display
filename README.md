# Design

Out of the box, Cupboard allows you to curate and design attractive masonry displays for digital signage. Load your content from links into a **Card**, then arrange cards to form a **Layout**. Select a layout from your layout collection, or cycle between layouts.

Your cards and layouts are provided client side by a Google Sheet, while a Google Form Embed allows you to author and save new layouts. We've provided templates for both of these, and instruction on how to connect them to them to Cupboard.

Please see internal video documentation for tutorials.
